**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?**

This past week, I was extremely busy. I had various home work assignments due, Collatz, career fair, and coding challenges. It felt amazing to have the week finally finish but it feels like the stress is still coming along. Alongside all the work, I managed to get a good grasp of what I'm looking for in an internship next summer. I can also say that I started managing my time better to ensure time worked on Collatz, algo homework, and preparing for career fair.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?**

In my way, I have much reading to catch up on. Since last week was so busy, I got left behind in a few of my classes. It sucks to think trying to get a job puts you behind in work at school, but hopefully it's all worth it. Once I can stop recruiting, a huge load will be off my head. Regardless, catching up and allowing that to procrastinate is most definitely in my way and something I need to get over with.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?**

This coming week, I'm going to work harder on doing more coding problems. I have a lot of homework due that I need to start yet I feel as though it's all just a distraction right now. Luckily, there's no SWE project due this week but I'm assuming we're getting our teams and the new project assigned. We just went over equivalence operators, sets, frozensets, etc. in class so I'm expecting some new material that I've never learned about before. Learning Malayalam also really tough so I'm going to have to take time out for that or else I'll get left behind in the class.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?**

Collatz was a fun project. It was quite unclear sometimes as the repo kept getting changed and instructions weren't always there but I guess that's how software engineering is. I understand that's how I'm going to learn the most, by experimenting and learning myself. If Downing continues with this method, I'm sure I'll come out of this class with a much better mindset and more knowledge. It feels like we're doing very workforce-like material that's going to be very useful in internships and for general knowledge of computer science. 

**TIP OF THE WEEK:**

My tip of the week is to join an activity that takes you totally out of thinking about school. For example, I play ultimate frisbee, and for the 9 hours of practice every week, I think only about ultimate frisbee. It's a great relief from school to just go out there and completely immerse myself for a few hours. I highly recommend this to people if they're getting stressed out about school sometimes. It's easy to get caught up in the sauce of recruiting.
