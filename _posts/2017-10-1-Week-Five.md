**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?**

This past week, I was extremely busy. Having both the SWE project and Algorithms homework due made this week stressful. There weren't many guidelines regarding the SWE project and using Google App Engine was a pain so it took quite a while. With these Algorithms homework assignments, you really have to take time out to understand what exactly the questions are asking and how to answer them. I also am getting better at using LaTex because that's how we turn in our assignments.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?**

In my way, is the idea of recruiting and school. Having to worry about both at the same time makes things extremely stressful. I don't know if I should give up one to focus on the other or to continue struggling to keep up both. I'm also an avid ultimate frisbee player and I'm not able to go for all of my practices anymore which is usually my time away from everything.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?**

This next week is going to be very busy. Packed with two tests and interviews, every day is going to be a grind. But as they say and I exclaim to my friends, the grind don't stop. I also think the SWE exam is coming up so I'll have to make sure I go over all of the small Python things Downing has been going over. I also have a frisbee tournament this weekend which is going to be super fun! It's actually going to be hosted at the IM fields so if you're available, come by!

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?**

This week was such a week for SWE. The project was due on Thursday and we had only started on Monday. This meant working super late on Wednesday and hoping everything would work out. Eventually, we did get everything working. It's interesting to see how we're going to progress with working on this website with a database and testing. I bet implementing the database isn't going to be easy.

**TIP OF THE WEEK:**

My tip of the week is to ensure you prioritize your friends over material fun. I think I made that mistake this weekend when a friend of mine came to Austin for the weekend and I'm not going to make it again. It sucks to think that time is so limited with the people you cherish, so sometimes step back and think about what's best for the long run in your relationships. These decisions you make are lasting.
