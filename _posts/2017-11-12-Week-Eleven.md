**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?**

This past week, I had an algorithms test and the SWE project due. It was hard keeping up after the weekend full of frisbee and not having much sleep, but I was able to pull through. I started cold emailing engineers at companies to get interviews, it's not going bad so far but it takes a lot more time than you would think.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?**

In my way, is the looming cloud above me of not having an internship for next summer. I rejected an offer last week due to the company giving me a bad vibe, but many of my friends have gotten their offers from the big companies. It kinda sucks to get pulled into this thought that interning at the big companies is like home free.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?**

This next week consists of emailing more and more companies to hopefully get interviews. At this point, I care so much more about a job than school because inevitably, that's what we're all trying to do. Pretty tired of this whole job search.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?**

This week, I got two 0's on my quizzes. I overslept on Friday and got both questions wrong on Wednesday. It was unclear how Dr. Downing phrased the question to know if we wanted duplicates or not. It was assumed to be in such a way that was vague to me and my friend in the class.

**TIP OF THE WEEK:**

I lost my phone last night in the Uber that I took. Make use of Find My iPhone as soon as possible when you realize you've lost your phone. Luckily, the Uber driver returned the phone to me yet I've come across many of my friends not having the option to track their phone on. When you get in that situation, that's your lifeline to get it back. What's cool is that you can set it to Lost Mode and display a message for the person that has it.
