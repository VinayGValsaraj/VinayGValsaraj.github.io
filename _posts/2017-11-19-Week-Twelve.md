**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?**

This past week, I had a more stress-free time without any tests or huge projects due. I started to get responses from the engineers I cold emailed which was huge. I also went to a college mixed regionals frisbee tournament this weekend which meant playing with both girls and boys. We won first at the tournament in the region beating out Kansas, OSU, OU, etc. !

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?**

In my way, is this week of Thanksgiving where all I want to go do is hang with my friends back home yet I also have much work to do. It seems like I'm going to grind during the day and late night and go hang out during the evening. It's super important to me to make the most of my time with those guys while I'm here.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?**

This next week consists of finishing my SWE tasks, Algo HW, and enjoying my time. Hopefully I can find that balance. I've also gotten quite rusty on interview questions so I need to freshen up badly.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?**

This week, I'm still not doing amazingly on quizzes which is irking me because my grade is slowly getting worse and worse. I also failed my team by not ensuring that we had credits during the grading period. At this point, I'm confused if I should stay in the class because I think it could only get worse. A 78% isn't extremely promising.

**TIP OF THE WEEK:**

I actually wondered with a friend recently why we chose Atom over Sublime Text. We kinda just started out by installing Atom and I still have no idea which one is better. With that said, I've customized Atom to how I can use it most efficiently, which you should for whatever text editor you're using. Evaluate what you can change about each to see what helps you the most instead of staying stagnant like I did and being closed-minded to other editors. I would highly recommend either of the two editors not only for code, but also for notetaking. Sublime Text can be found here: https://www.sublimetext.com/ and Atom can be found here: https://atom.io/
