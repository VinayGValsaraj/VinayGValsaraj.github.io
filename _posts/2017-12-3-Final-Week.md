**Overall Experience of the Class?**

I took CS373 with Downing because it was recommended heavily by my boss at my internship. He said that Software Engineering would add on to all of the skills I learned over the summer and prepare me for the workforce further, a must take.

Over the semester, we were using and learning Python, SQL, and Java. Every morning, we were greeted with a daily quiz over the material from the last class or readings from the week. Many of these quizzes I found to be too detailed for the 4 minutes we have to take the quiz. This caused many answers to be forced, therefore getting lower and lower scores on the quizzes which was our attendance.

Dr. Downing provides an interesting way of learning by actively discussing with particular students during the class. I thoroughly enjoyed this form of teaching because it felt very interactive. It kind of puts students on the spot.

One thing that I would say I didn't enjoy about the class was Test 1 on Python for us. It felt more of a bunch of trick questions rather than knowing how to code in Python and what we would actually use. A disclaimer in the class was that the lectures would be completely separate from the projects but this meant that we rarely went over things we would be using over class. This meant rushing and completing tasks maybe not the best way, and now I'm still not sure if what I did was the best route.

Overall, I learned a lot over the semester both in class and out of class during the projects and gained much team experience. I would recommend the class to others but to be weary of the readings and communication between your team members.
