title: The Future of Business

What does an ethical company look like to me? The product and its quality, general culture, and involvement in the community are a few of the many important things. The first company that comes to mind is the large American clothing brand called Patagonia. Based in Ventura, California and started in 1973, Patagonia is known for and brands itself as being at the forefront of environmental activism.

Patagonia places a large emphasis on minimizing environmental impact in the production of their products. All of their cotton is certified organic by the Global Organic Textile Standard and a large chunk of their products are made from recycled fabrics including polyester, nylon, and wool (Wolfe). Their products are made with such quality to reject "fast fashion" in intending each of their products to last an extremely long time. This goes to even the extent of placing a full-page ad in the New York Times on Black Friday with the title "DON'T BUY THIS JACKET." Their emphasis was to don't buy what you don't need, Patagonia would help repair your jackets, and even help find new homes for your old jackets. While still trying to grow a business and sell products, they think it's hypocritical to push to purchase their products while also working towards environmental change. According to the 2017 Ethical Fashion Report, Patagonia received the second highest rating focusing on living wage payment, transparency, and worker empowerment (Wolfe).

As you can see, Patagonia has a strong focus on treating their employees well as well as creating quality products intended to last with lesser environmental impact. If I were to start a company myself, I would put these facets at the top of my priorities. What I see as a limitation, however, is the idea of competition. Companies like North Face and Black Diamond may have cheaper products and great business in effect but different ways of handling employees and manufacturing. I bet there are many more factors in determining how to run a successful company while also following ideal practices but one has to try and find the balance to keep the company and one's conscience afloat.
