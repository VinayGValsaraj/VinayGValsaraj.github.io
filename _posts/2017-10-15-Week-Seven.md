**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?**

This past week, I had the SWE exam and a ton of interview prep. I can't tell if most people just keep doing questions to get better at them or if some people just get this stuff. I don't think I'm particularly amazing, yet I spend so much time hacking away at questions and trying to see the mindset required to find that answer.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?**

In my way, is the fact that I have been so busy with recruiting and school, that I wish I could just have a break. The thing is, if I don't stop until I succeed, only good will happen in the future for my career. I don't have much time to hang out with friends or play frisbee just because all of this is taking over my life.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?**

This next week is filled more with recruiting than school. My exam weeks have passed so now we're just learning material, yet I have many recruiting events to attend this week which will take most of my free time. I also need to start my algorithms homework which usually always takes quite a bit of time.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?**

Well, we had our first exam last week. I can't say I did well but I also was unsure of many questions on the test. I was confused by many of the questions and we were supposed to I guess learn the many ways things can happen. It's weird to me that we're doing straight up Python testing in a software engineering class.

**TIP OF THE WEEK:**

My tip of the week is for those who don't listen to music often: listen more. If you ever saw me outside of class, I'm usually listening to music. It's amazing what it can do to people's emotions and how it can change outlooks on situations. I don't know exactly what it is but music is so essential to our lives and especially mine, that I wouldn't be able to live without it. Hype music can always get me excited and sad music can always get me in the feels. I don't know how it does it but it's something everyone should cherish.
