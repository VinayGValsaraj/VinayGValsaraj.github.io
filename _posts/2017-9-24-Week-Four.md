**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?**

This past week, I was not as busy. I practiced frisbee twice for three hours, had my first phone interview, and started catching up in my classes. Programming for Correctness and Performance has been getting harder, yet recruiting has taken away much of my time. As I'm writing this, I'm struggling to recount what exactly I did this week, which I can't imagine is good. The normal regimen of going to classes, connecting with old friends, and always eating well is always there. My first phone interview was sort of nerve-racking, basically trying to assess my thinking skills and how I would be a fit for the company.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?**

In my way, my focus isn't on school currently. I need to get into that mindset. My current thoughts are just getting a job for next summer, and once that is achieved, a huge load is going to be lifted off my head. School's starting to pile up and really get more tough. Weekly algorithm assignments also aren't easy because they're mainly proofs. Proofs have never been my strength so they're always time-consuming. It's interesting to understand how to prove an algorithm correct, e.g. summing a list of numbers.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?**

This coming week, I plan on getting my head back into the game of school. I didn't really do anything productive this weekend, and it would help to refocus my mind on school and recruiting. I plan on having a few late nights in the PCL to grind out some work and studying. We also have the final cut for our frisbee team tomorrow so I'll be working harder to make the new recruits more comfortable. We also have our first tournament this coming week and my parents/grandma will be coming to Austin! It'll be a great time showing them around.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?**

This week, we got to learn a lot about assignments of variables and also about the GCP. We also got to choose our own groups, which is great because I get to work with my friends. The best part is that since we worked together for CS439, we know how we are under stress. It'll be a great dynamic, plus we can coordinate our schedules way easier than having random teammates. I also enjoy how the class is pretty fast-paced, hour long interactive sessions. I never feel tired while in class and am usually super into it throughout the hour.

**TIP OF THE WEEK:**

My tip of the week is to write down the names of people on your phone right after you meet them. Addressing people by their name when they think you might have forgotten it later is always a plus. It also starts to amass to you how many people you meet and helps you remember to keep in contact with them. I've started doing it and I've actually gone back to look at it sometimes. For example, there's a really funny server at Burrito Factory under Dobie. His names Juan.
