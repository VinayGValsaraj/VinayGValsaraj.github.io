**WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF THE CLASS?**
CS 373 with Downing was a recommendation from my boss during my internship. Most of my work has been focused on development to an existing web application. I'm extremely excited to get to learn the entire works of a web application and everything that goes into keeping it running. This includes continuous integration, unit testing, backups, etc. I've only been a witness to all of the parts required so this will be a huge learning experience. I've also only dabbled in Python before so gaining new knowledge of popular languages is always beneficial.

**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?**
This past week, I was busy trying to find a way to get to Austin for school starting. Because I live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, driving became not an option as Hurricane Harvey closed off most roads. This made me check into flights which were all trying to fly through Houston International Airport. Eventually, I found a connecting flight from MSY->DAL->AUS. Other than that, this is my first year living in a house instead of an apartment. I'm still getting used to the whole experience and bonding with my new roommates.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?**
Personally, I feel as though I don't put enough time into programming and all of the quirks of computer science. When out of class and on the weekends, you won't find me on a computer coding but rather down the street at the field throwing a frisbee around. This may be something I can develop but I feel as though I should start trying. This also goes hand-in-hand with not managing time well towards exploring new technology/languages/frameworks and instead browsing YouTube.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?**
For next week, I hope to have all of my textbooks together, mindset ready for school, and the ability to curb distractions. Regarding SWE, I'll need to start getting into the vibe of Python and get familiar with the various development tools we will be using this semester.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?**
So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed class as Downing manages to keep the class exciting all the way through. I like that he sometimes discusses 1-on-1 with students during class to keep it energetic and students involved. It also seems as though Downing keeps a good tab on all things covered in class to review before the next class which helps a ton.

**PICK/TIP OF THE WEEK?**
As a Macbook user, we're not given built-in tools to resize windows to half the screen vertically/horizontally. During the summer, I found a widget named Spectacle (https://www.spectacleapp.com/) which helps immensely with this exact problem. It gives easy-to-use keyboard shortcuts that allow resizing and moving of windows with extreme ease. I would recommend this widget to any Mac users because it has helped with productivity. Personally, I think it should be built into the next update of Mac OS. Using it always makes me wish I would've thought of something so simple yet so useful. As they say, some of the best products are those that people don't realize they need until they have it.
