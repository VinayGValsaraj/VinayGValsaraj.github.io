**WHAT DID YOU DO THIS PAST WEEK?**

This past week, I had an onsite interview in D.C. which was an amazing experience. I got to see the White House, Washington Monument, Smithsonian, and Lincoln Memorial. I really wanted to see the Thomas Jefferson Memorial too as it has a super nice view but it was a few blocks away. I've never done something like that alone in a city before, which was a new yet fulfilling experience.

**WHAT'S IN YOUR WAY?**

In my way, is the fear of burning out. I've been grinding extremely hard on interview prep and school the past few weeks that I'm afraid of this feeling of becoming too content. Or thinking that maybe I've done enough studying. It's a mindset that I can definitely push through but it's something lurking in my mind which I 100% acknowledge is going on.

**WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT WEEK?**

This next week consists of working on the SWE project and an algorithm assignment. I'm in charge of creating the database in the group, which I feel like has been a daunting task. I've never had experience with this especially using Google Cloud. I feel as though this makes the workflow much more complicated.

**WHAT'S MY EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS?**

The one time I don't come to class for an interview, my name of course gets called. I still do enjoy the fact that Dr. Downing does a discussion style in class. I'm also glad that we're moving into SQL because I find SQL queries and how to retrieve information super intuitive.

**TIP OF THE WEEK:**

My tip of the week is to download the Hacker News app on the App Store. It basically creates a reddit-style news feed of technology articles that are prominent in the tech world. https://news.ycombinator.com/ is the link that the information is being scraped from. Even without the app, I find reading these articles when I'm bored is incredibly interesting instead of just browsing Facebook/Instagram.
